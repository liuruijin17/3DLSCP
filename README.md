**3DLSCP**: Learning to Predict 3D Lane Shape and Camera Pose from a Single Image via Geometry Constraints
=======

* Predicting 3D lanes and camera pose from a single image.
* Obtaining top-view images using estimated camera pose while achieving state-of-the-art 3D lane performance.
* Learning via geometry constraints to improve performances on both tasks.
